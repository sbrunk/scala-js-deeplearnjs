# Scala.js-TensorFlow.js Example: Mobilenet

This example shows you how to load a pretrained mobilenet model.
It has been ported to Scala.js from https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/mobilenet

The mobilenet used in this example was ported from
[this](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/releases/download/v0.6/mobilenet_2_5_224_tf.h5)
Keras pretrained mobilenet model and hosted online for your convenience.

If you want, you can port your own mobilenet model by using the Keras converter script which
can be found [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-converter).
